# Phaser Arcade Slopes Plugin

**Arcade Slopes** brings sloped tile collision handling to
[Phaser](http://phaser.io)'s [Arcade
Physics](http://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/arcade-physics) engine.

## [Demo](http://hexus.github.io/phaser-arcade-slopes)

Check out the **[demo](http://hexus.github.io/phaser-arcade-slopes)**!

### Enabling the plugin

Enable the plugin in the `create()` method of your Phaser state.

```js
game.plugins.add(Phaser.Plugin.ArcadeSlopes);
```

### Mapping tiles

The plugin provides a couple of built in tile slope mappings:

- [Arcade Slopes tileset](assets)
  (`arcadeslopes`)
  ([16px](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexus/phaser-arcade-slopes/master/assets/arcade-slopes-16.png),
  [32px](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexus/phaser-arcade-slopes/master/assets/arcade-slopes-32.png),
  [64px](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexus/phaser-arcade-slopes/master/assets/arcade-slopes-64.png),
  [128px](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexus/phaser-arcade-slopes/master/assets/arcade-slopes-128.png))
- [Ninja Physics debug tileset](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.4.7/resources/Ninja%20Physics%20Debug%20Tiles)
  (`ninja`)
  ([32px](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/photonstorm/phaser/v2.4.7/resources/Ninja%20Physics%20Debug%20Tiles/32px/ninja-tiles32.png), [64px](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/photonstorm/phaser/v2.4.7/resources/Ninja%20Physics%20Debug%20Tiles/64px/ninja-tiles64.png),
  [128px](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/photonstorm/phaser/v2.4.7/resources/Ninja%20Physics%20Debug%20Tiles/128px/ninja-tiles128.png))

After you've created a tilemap with a collision layer, you'll need to convert
that layer to work with Arcade Slopes.

```js
// Create the tilemap and make it aware of the tileset it uses
map = game.add.tilemap('tilemap');
map.addTilesetImage('collision', 'arcade-slopes-32');
map.setCollisionBetween(1, 38);

// Create the collision layer from the tilemap
ground = map.createLayer('collision');

// Convert the collision layer to work with Arcade Slopes
game.slopes.convertTilemapLayer(ground, 'arcadeslopes');
```

In the case that the first tile ID of the collision tileset in your tilemap is
not `1` (the default), you can provide a third argument to specify it. The
arguments provided to the `setCollisionBetween()` method may need to be adjusted
as well.

```js
map.setCollisionBetween(16, 53);
game.slopes.convertTilemapLayer(ground, 'ninja', 16);
```

**Please note:** Tile GIDs in maps exported from Tiled are always one more than
the ID shown in the GUI. Arcade Slopes expects the above parameter to match the
first GID _as specified in the Tiled map data_.

### Enabling physics bodies

Now you need to enable slopes for any game entities you want to collide against
the tilemap.

```js
game.physics.arcade.enable(player);

game.slopes.enable(player);
game.slopes.enable(emitter);
```

You don't need to do anything special for circular physics bodies, just the
usual `sprite.body.setCircle(radius)`.

_Make sure you call `game.slopes.enable(object)` **after** making any changes to
the **size** or **shape** of the physics body._

### Collision

Now you can collide your sprite against the tilemap in the `update()` method of
your Phaser state, as you normally would, using Arcade Physics. Voila!

```js
// Collide the player with the collision layer
game.physics.arcade.collide(player, ground);

// Collide the particles with the collision layer
game.physics.arcade.collide(emitter, ground);
```

### Debug rendering

To debug your collision layer, set its debug property to `true`.

This will overlay the collision shapes of each tile when the layer is rendered.

```js
ground.debug = true;
```

### Extras

#### Minimum Y offset

This feature separates rectangular physics bodies on the Y axis only, in the
right situations.

```js
// Prefer the minimum Y offset for this physics body
player.body.slopes.preferY = true;

// Prefer the minimum Y offset globally
game.slopes.preferY = true;
```

If you're making a platformer, your player has drag on the X axis, and you don't
want it to slide down slopes, this should solve your problem.

#### Collision pulling

To attempt to keep objects on a surface, you can use collision pulling.

This will pull physics bodies into a collision by a set velocity, if it matches
the set direction.

```js
// Pull the player into downwards collisions with a velocity of 50
player.body.slopes.pullDown = 50;
```

Here are the available properties for collision pulling:

```js
body.slopes.pullUp
body.slopes.pullDown
body.slopes.pullLeft
body.slopes.pullRight
body.slopes.pullTopLeft
body.slopes.pullTopRight
body.slopes.pullBottomLeft
body.slopes.pullBottomRight
```

## Building

If you want to build the plugin yourself from source, clone the repository and
run NPM and Gulp like so.

```bash
npm install
gulp build
```

There's also a watch task that builds the plugin whenever you make changes
to the source.

```bash
gulp watch
```
